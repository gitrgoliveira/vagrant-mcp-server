# Vagrant MCP Server - Development Summary

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the implemented components for the Vagrant MCP Server, which enables AI agents to create, manage, and interact with Vagrant development VMs.

## Components Implemented

### MCP Server Framework
- Implemented in `pkg/mcp/server.go`
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling
- Tool and resource registration and dispatch
- Support for stdio and SSE transports

### VM Management
- VM Manager for Vagrant operations (`internal/vm/manager.go`)
- Tools for VM lifecycle: create_dev_vm, ensure_dev_vm, destroy_dev_vm
- VM state tracking and configuration management

### File Synchronization
- Sync Engine (`internal/sync/engine.go`) 
- Bidirectional sync support
- Sync conflict resolution
- Tools: sync_to_vm, sync_from_vm, sync_status, resolve_sync_conflicts

### Command Execution
- Execution engine for running commands in VMs
- Stream handling for real-time output
- Tools: exec_in_vm, exec_with_sync

### Development Environment
- Runtime detection and configuration
- Tools: setup_dev_environment, install_dev_tools, configure_shell
- Support for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Resource Endpoints
- VM status and configuration resources
- File system access resources
- Environment variables resources
- Services status resources
- Network configuration resources
- Monitoring resources
- Log access resources
- Installed tools resources

## Resources
The following MCP resources are implemented:

| Resource Path | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| devvm://status | Current development VM status and health |
| devvm://config | VM configuration and sync settings |
| devvm://files/{path} | Access to VM file system |
| devvm://env | Environment variables and PATH details |
| devvm://installed-tools | List of installed development tools |
| devvm://services | Status of development services |
| devvm://network | Network configuration and connectivity |
| devvm://logs/{type} | Access to VM logs (sync, provisioning) |
| devvm://monitoring/{metric} | VM monitoring metrics (cpu, memory, disk, processes) |

## Tools
The following MCP tools are implemented:

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| create_dev_vm | Create a new development VM with specified configuration |
| ensure_dev_vm | Ensure a development VM exists and is running with specified configuration |
| destroy_dev_vm | Destroy a development VM and clean up resources |
| sync_to_vm | Synchronize files from host to VM |
| sync_from_vm | Synchronize files from VM to host |
| sync_status | Get the current sync status and conflicts |
| resolve_sync_conflicts | Resolve synchronization conflicts |
| exec_in_vm | Execute a command in the VM |
| exec_with_sync | Execute a command with synchronization before/after |
| setup_dev_environment | Install language runtimes and dependencies |
| install_dev_tools | Install development tools in the VM |
| configure_shell | Configure shell environment in the VM |

## Next Steps
1. Add additional integration tests for all tools and resources
2. Improve error handling and recovery
3. Add support for more VM types beyond Vagrant
4. Enhance monitoring capabilities
5. Implement more advanced sync conflict resolution strategies

## Integration Testing
Test the server by running:
```
cd cmd/server
LOG_LEVEL=debug go run .
```
